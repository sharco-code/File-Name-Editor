# File-Name-Editor
This program removes a part of name from all files located on folder where the program is

I had a problem, i had more than 5GB of songs (mp3 files) in my PC... these songs have an annoying thing, this is their name.
Almost all the names of the songs begin with a number followed by a dash (-); 

Example: "3 - Linkin Park - Forgotten.mp3"

And so with the other 5 gb of songs, i was too lazy to edit the names of all that bunch of songs and I decided to program something that would do it for me, so the program edits the names of the files in a folder to remove that substring

# OPERATING EXAMPLE
If you have a file called "3 - Linkin Park - Forgotten.mp3", run the program and now your song is called "Linkin Park - Forgotten.mp3"

# HOW TO USE
Put the .exe in the folder where the files you want to rename are located
